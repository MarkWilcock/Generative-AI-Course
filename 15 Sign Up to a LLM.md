# Sign up to a free LLM service

During the course, there are several lab exercises to interact and experiment with LLMs.  There are several popular LLMs that offer a free version which is sufficient for most of the exercises.  Students are free to use any service but here are a few suggested options: ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude and Gemini.  These are all available using a browser - no installation is required.

## ChatGPT
The official ChatGPT page at https://chat.openai.com. You can sign up in the usual way, using an email address or via a Google, Microsoft or Apple account.

## Microsoft Copilot
You need to use the Microsoft browser Edge to make the best use of Copilot.  The start page is at https://www.bing.com/chat

Microsoft has a useful user guide for effective prompting [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/do-more-with-ai/ai-prompt-writing).

Copilot is built on ChatGPT but also takes into account your data and activities in your Microsoft account (recorded in the Microsoft Graph).  Here is a good summary.
