# Use AI tools Effectively - Starter Tasks Exercise 

In this exercise, We will split the class into four teams.  Each team focusses an a different type of activity. Teams try various styles of interaction with an AI.  For example, they will ask the AI tool to brainstorm, plan, explain, summarise and critique, and suggest solutions to problems. 

## Instructions
Agree a chairperson who will summarise the group's conclusions to the class.  Consider
* is the response helpful and is it what you expected?
* if the response was not what you expected or hoped for, why was that?  Can you ask a follow-on prompt (or edit the original prompt) to clarify and get a better response?
* does the AI's response help you to be quicker or to produce a better outcome for a task?  Or both?  Or neither?
* please let the class know about any very interesting interaction
* what data sources did the AI use to formulate the response? Directly from your prompt? From its training? By searching the internet in response to the prompt? Or has it simply made up some stuff? (often referred to as hallucinating)

After the first prompt, we may want to provide a follow up prompt, with more specific details and/or a clarification or extension of our original question.  Consider:
* does this improve the AI tool's response?
* how much does this feel like a natural conversation?

These are some suggestions to get you started but please use your own ideas also.

## Planners

### Tasks
Here are some suggested starter prompts for the planner team. These incorporate ideas for plans for activities that take a few minutes to a few decades
* Create a 5 step plan for the NHS to handle the next pandemic.
* How do I make the perfect omelette?  Provide a step by step instructions.
* I am planning a trip to Paris in the spring.  Could you suggest 10 top tourist sights?
* I am a NHS Nurse.  How do I become Chief Executive of NHS England in 12 easy steps?


## Reviewers
Reviewers evaluate, summariuse and improve some text.  They may also change the style and tone.

1. We need to recruit a data analyst to work our NHS hospital in central London.  Draft a job description that we can provide to recruitment agencies and the NHS Jobs website. The candidate must have experience of MSOffice and in particular Excel.  We seek a person who has at least 5 years of previous experience as a data analyst.  This can be in either the public or private sector environment.  Power BI and SQL skills would be a bonus. In particular, 10 years experience and a high level expertise of using the Gobbledegook MIS system, which is the main business intelligence system used in our trust, is a mandatory requirement.   
_Follow-on prompt:_ We are desperate to fill this post so revise the job description to make it as enticing as possible.  
_Follow on prompt:_ Can you make this more formal while keeping the enticing tone.

1. Please summarise the information about the recent BBC Strictly series in this webpage into two paragraphs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing_series_21
1. This page https://digital-transformation.hee.nhs.uk/building-a-digital-workforce/phillips-ives-review and the pages that it links to, explain The Phillips Ives Nursing and Midwifery Review. Summarise the content of these pages in 5 short paragraphs.

Download a document from a public web page and then prompt the AI to summarise and review the document.  Example prompts are:
* Please summarise in fewer than 300 words
* How could this article be improved to make more clear and compelling?
* The article discusses ... (e.g. rise of vaping in the UK and suggests it is a good thing).  Provide three arguments to support this conclusion and three argument against it.
* Explain the main points of the article as if speaking to a 10 year old child.


## Explainers
* Explain to me like I am a five year old what the NHS does.

=XLOOKUP(G18,$D$18:$D$21,$C18:$C$21)  
* Explain what went wrong in the recent cybersecurity breach of the British Library?

Ask the AI to explain concepts from science and technology, for example:
* Explain quantum computing in simple terms, focusing on how it differs from classical computing.
* How does the internet work, from a basic webpage request to the final display on a user's screen?
* What is CRISPR and how does it enable genetic editing? Provide a basic overview suitable for someone without a scientific background.
* Explain the significance of the Renaissance period in Europe, highlighting key figures and achievements

 And also for history and culture, for example:
 * Can you explain the significance of the Renaissance period in Europe, highlighting key figures and achievements?
 * Why was King Charles I tried and found guilty of treason?

And from economics and finance, for example:
* What is a cryptocurrency, and how does it differ from traditional forms of money? Provide a simple explanation of how it works.
* What is inflation, and what the role of the Bank Of England in controlling it?

And the arts and literature, for example:
* How has William Shakespeare influenced modern literature and the English language?

Use the RICE framework to improve and hone our prompts and (hopefully) the AI tool will respond with more useful suggestions.  Here are some example prompts, to plan a family summer holiday, but please use your own ideas. 

### Task 1 
Start with a vague but typical prompt. e.g. Suggest 5 ideas for good holiday.

### Task  2
Provide a more detailed, specific prompt using the RICE framework. Build this up step-by-step.  here are some more specific prompts building on the holiday planning theme.

Role: Act as an expert in holiday planning.  Your clients live in the UK.  Keep your responses brief. Provide a link for any suggestions that you make.

Instructions: Suggest 5 ideas for good summer holiday for a family from London.

Constraints / Context:  Here is some more information about us. We live in London but would like to holiday abroad. We like exploring cities but also want to get out of the city to walk in beautiful countryside. We are interested in football stadiums, so we would consider visiting cities that are home to a prominent football team. We don't want to fly to go on holiday.  We are happy to take the train or do a cruise.   Please revise your suggestions.

Here is an example of the type of response I need. Milan is a lovely city for families on holiday.  It has many attractions e.g. the Duomo, Michaelangelo's Last Supper.  There are beautiful tourist locations near to the city. for example, Bergamo is a historic hilltop town only a short train journey from Milan.  The famous San Siro football stadium, used by both AC Milan and Inter Milan, is situated on the outskirts of the city.  Milan can be reached by train from London with an overnight stop in Paris.   Please revise your suggestions to respond in this style.
