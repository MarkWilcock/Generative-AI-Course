# Introduction to ChatGPT – what is it and how is it useful?

ChatGPT is a useful, practical productivity tool. It can help us do some tasks better and other tasks quicker.  It is a large language model built by a company, OpenAI and represents a breakthrough in artificial intelligence. It has ‘read’ a significant portion of the public internet and has been trained to provide relevant helpful responses to any questions we may pose to it.  For example, it can:
* provide step-by-step instructions for a task,
* draft a letter with the right tone and style,
* review and suggest improvements to a document or text,
* brainstorm ideas on a topic and
* explain and summarise a document.

ChatGPT has a free and paid versions.  The free version is sufficient for most tasks. To sign up, open a browser and go to OpenAI's official ChatGPT page at  https://chat.openai.com. You can sign up in the usual way, using an email address or via a Google/Microsoft/Apple account.

In the exercises, you will use ChatGPT to provide helpful answer to relevant tasks.
ChatGPT has weaknesses as well as its considerable strengths and here are the three points to bear in mind:
1. ChatGPT can make mistakes. Always check any important results independently.
2. ChatGPT remembers and learns from every prompt. Never put any confidential information into ChatGPT. Keep your data private.
3. ChatGPT has learnt from everything on the internet: all the amazing, wonderful content but also some undesirable stuff. OpenAI have put “guard rails” in place but it is capable of bias so review its output carefully!

### Exercise 1: Get Started With ChatGPT

**Task 1**
Ask ChatGPT a question (provide a prompt) and read its response.  Consider:
* was the response helpful?  
* was the response what you expected?

**Task 2**
Continue the conversation and provide a follow up prompt, with more specific details and/or  a clarification / extension of your original question.  Consider:
* does this improve ChatGPT's response?
* how much does this feel like a natural conversation?

**Task 3**  Try various styles of conversation and tasks.  For example, Ask ChatGPT to brainstorm, plan, explain, summarise and critique, and suggest solutions to problems. Here are some suggestions to get you started but please use your own ideas.

Brainstorm: 
* Provide some suggestions for a surpise birthday party.  
* I am writing a spy novel. Suggest some titles that will make it fly off the bookshelves. 

Plan:  
How do I make the perfect omelette?  Provide a step by step instructions.

Summarise and critique/ review:   
Copy an article from a public web page, for example a news article, then ask:  
* Please summarise in fewer than 300 words
* How could this article be improved to make more clear and compelling?
* The article discusses the rise of vaping in the UK and suggests it is a good thing.  Provide three arguments to support this conclusion and three argument against it.
* Explain the main points of the article as if speaking to a 10 year old child.

Understand what went wrong and suggest how to fix it.  
* This Excel formula produces incorrect results in some cells but is correct in others.  Can you explain why?  
=XLOOKUP(G18,$D$18:$D$21,$C18:$C$21)  

Explain:  
* Why is the sky blue?  
* And the grass green?


## How to get better responses from ChatGPT

We talk with ChatGPT by providing a question or instruction (called a prompt). ChatGPT responds and then we can prompt again and ChatGPT will respond again – and so on.  We can help ChatGPT help us with more relevant, accurate responses if we provide more tailored prompts. One framework to help us with this is RICE: this stands for Role, Instructions, Context (and Constraints) and Examples. 
* Role: ask ChatGPT to act in a certain role e.g., an expert travel advisor, and tell it how to respond e.g. brief or verbose, friendly or formal. Also, for example, tell ChatGPT to provide a link to a relevant web page with each response.
* Instructions: provide specific, concrete instructions to ChatGPT. (This is the most important piece of advice.)
* Context (and constraints): provide background information that will help ChatGPT tailor its response.
* Example: provide an example of the sort of response that you would like to see. 

In the exercise we ask ChatGPT to plan a family summer holiday.  We start with a vague prompt and ChatGPT replies in a good but not particularly helpful manner. We then uses the RICE framework to improve his prompts and ChatGPT responds with more useful suggestions.


### Exercise 2: Improve ChatGPT responses

In this exercise, we will work in groups of about 4 - 5 people in breakout rooms.   Students may want to give themselves 10 minutes or so experimenting with ChatGPT individually before coming together as a group.  In teh instructions there are some example prompts but please use your own ideas. 

**Task 1** Start with a vague but typical prompt. Here are some prompt examples but please use your own ideas.  
Suggest 5 ideas for good holiday

**Task  2** provide a more detailed, specific prompt using the RICE framework.

Role: Act as an expert in holiday planning.  Your clients live in the UK.  Keep your responses brief. Provide a link for any suggestions that you make.

Instructions: Suggest 5 ideas for good summer holiday for a family from London

Constraints / Context:  Here is some more information about us. We live in London but would like to holiday abroad. We like exploring cities but also want to get out of the city to walk in beautiful countryside. We are interested in football stadiums, so we would consider visiting cities that are home to a prominent football team. Please revise your suggestions

We don't want to fly to go on holiday.  We are happy to take the train or do a cruise.   Please revise your suggestions.

Here is an example of the type of response I need.  
*Milan is a lovely city for families on holiday.  It has many attractions e.g. the Duomo, Michaelangelo's Last Supper.  
There are beautiful tourist locations near to the city. for example, Bergamo is a historic hilltop town only a short train journey from Milan.  The famous San Siro football stadium, used by both AC Milan and Inter Milan, is situated on the outskirts of the city.
Milan can be reached by train from London with an overnight stop in Paris.*  

## Top tips for using ChatGPT

A basic instruction alone may not result in a good response.  Here are a few pointers to obtain better responses from ChatGPT.

* Make the instruction more specific.
* Tell GPT what role you want it to play.
* Provide context and relevant background.
* Describe any constraints.
* Provide an example of the response required.
* Refine your prompt and continue the conversation.
* Use RICE to remember: Role, Instructions, Context & Constraints, Examples.
* Create a new chat and ask a new question on a different topic.
