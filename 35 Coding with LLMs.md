# Use LLMs to assist with SQL and Python

LLMs are exceptionally good at helping us understand, learn, and write code.  SQL and Python are the two main languages for data analysis.  These LLMs, wrapped in an application or user interface, are often called code-assistants or pair-programmers.  They help in many ways:
* If we are writing a line of code, they can suggest possible ways we want to complete that line or block of code.
* We can state our intent (what we want to do) in English (other human languages are available possibly to lesser extents) in a comment line and they will write the code below the comment.
* They can review, explain, and add comments to existing code.
* They can improve the code to a better standard and quality.
* If our code has generated an error, they can explain why the error occurred, explain how to fix it and possibly fix it for us.

Examples of code assistants include:
* GitHub Copilot:  Works with popular (free) VSCode editor.  It is popular for Python and SQL.
* Copilot in Microsoft Fabric Python notebooks;
* (In beta currently), an assistant in Google Colab Python notebooks.
