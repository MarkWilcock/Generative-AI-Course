# Resources - Learn more about Generative AI

Here are some resources for learning more about Generative AI.

##  Overviews of Generative AI

Microsoft have a great course [Introduction to Gen AI](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners).  This comes highly reccommended.

At a recent Turing Institute lecture, Mirella Lapata gave a wonderful overview. [What is generative AI and how does it work? – The Turing Lectures with Mirella Lapata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6R7Ym6Vy_I)

 Henrik Kniberg has a short video on how to survive and thrive in the age of AI. [Generative AI in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IK3DFHRFfw).

## More technical details about how LLMs work 

Andrej Kaparthy explains the maths of back propogation in neural nets. [The spelled-out intro to neural networks and backpropagation: building micrograd](https://youtu.be/VMj-3S1tku0?si=_guPyeexsGlA7nvn).

## Example datasets

If you plan to experiment with data analysis using LLMs here are a couple of  good public datasets
* an [electric vehicle population dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ratikkakkar/electric-vehicle-population-data).
