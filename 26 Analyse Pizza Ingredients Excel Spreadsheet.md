Download and inspect the [Pizza Ingedients Excel spreadsheet](./Resources/Pizza%20Ingredients.xlsx) This is based on a beginner level Excel lesson to teach formulas and relative and fixed references.

Here are some suggested prompts to start your analysis.
* Import the attached spreadsheet then describe it.
* The data is in an Excel table named Items.  List the columns of this table.
* What formula should we enter for the CostExVAT column?
* Can you restate this formula using the fact that these columns are in an Excel table.
* And for the VAT column?
* And for the CostIncVAT column?
* Consider that VAT can change from time to time and note that cell C2 contains the prevailing VAT rate.  Change your formula suggestions to take account of this.
* Note that cell C2 is a named cell vat_rate.  Revise the formulas to take this into account.
* Add these formulas to the Excel file and export it.
