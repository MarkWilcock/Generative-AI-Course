# Sign up to the free service of an AI tool

During the course, there are several lab exercises to interact and experiment with AI tools.  The most popular ones are ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude and Gemini.  These have both free and paid versions.  In this course, the free version is sufficient for most tasks. These are all available using a browser - no installation is required.

## OpenAI's ChatGPT
The official ChatGPT page at https://chat.openai.com. You can sign up in the usual way, using an email address or via a Google, Microsoft or Apple account.

## Microsoft's Copilot
You need to use the Microsoft browser Edge to make the best use of Copilot.  The start page is at https://www.bing.com/chat

Microsoft has a useful user guide for effective prompting [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/do-more-with-ai/ai-prompt-writing).

Copilot is built on ChatGPT but also takes into account your data and activities in your Microsoft account (recorded in the Microsoft Graph).  Here is a good summary.

The [Copilot Labs](https://copilot.cloud.microsoft/en-GB/prompts?ocid=copilot_akams_copilotlab) are are great start for exploring Copilot’s capbilities.

## Anthropic's Claude

The sign up page is [here](https://claude.ai/chats).  You can sign in with an email address or a Google account.

## Google's Gemini
The sign up page is [here](https://gemini.google.com/). You will need a Google account – if you don’t already have one, you can create one for free.

# Exercise - Sign up to at least three of these services

These AI services all produce really great responses. The reason that attendees need to sign up to three services at least are:
* the free versions of these tools may occasionally lock us out for a certain time period after we have used our quota of prompts. In that case we can simply switch to another service.  (Note that the service may simply lock is out of using their latest and greatest version of the model but allow us to continue using the tool with an older version which for our purposes may work just as well.)
* These AIs have a different set of capabilities and some tasks may not be possible in a particular AI.  For example, we can provide a URL to ChatGPT and it will read the content of that web page, and any linked pages also if requested.  However, at the current time of writing, June 2024, Claude cannot do this.
* it is interesting to compare the responses of different AIs to the same prompt - where are they similar and where are they different?
