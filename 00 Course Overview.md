# Generative AI Course Overview

These are the materials for a one day course - an introduction to Generative AI.   This is a beginner level course for a general audience.  No previous knowledge or experience of Generative AI is required.  It focuses on one form of Generative AI: large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.  LLMs have practical use and can increase our productivity today: they can engage in a conversation with us and plan, brainstorm, summarise and explain.  AI tools are also useful for data analysis and for helping us write in computer languages such as SQL or Python.  

## Course Content
The course covers:
* an introduction to Generative AI and an explanation of LLMs;
* getting started with generative AI; signing up to a free service
* a tour of some current Generative AI services and LLMs: Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Clause and Google's Gemini;
* practical exercises on how to use LLMs effectively (prompt engineering) to be more productive in everyday tasks;

Many people use Excel at work and  the course shows how AI tools can help us with Excel challenges.

The course explains how AI tools are very useful for analysing data.

Large language models **excel** at understanding and helping us to write and learn computer languages. The course may cover:
The course may include several specific use cases of using AI tools if attendees find these relevant to their work:
* to help use write code in SQL;
* to help use write code in Python (the de-facto open source language for data science and AI) and
* to help use write code in DAX (the modelling language of Power BI).

The course finishes with a brief explanation of how Generative AI works "under the covers".

## Course Style
The course has has both tutorials and group exercises.  In tutorials, attendees follow the instructor step by step or prompt-by-prompt.  In the group exercises, attendees work in groups of about 4 - 5 people in breakout rooms for about 10 - 15 minutes. Once back in the main room, a spokesperson for each group summarises their conclusions to the class.  

In previous course, students preferred to give themselves 5 minutes or so to work individually before the group discussion commenced - check with your group if you want to do this.
