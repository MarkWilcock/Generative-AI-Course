# Generative AI Course Overview

These are the materials for a one day course - an introduction to Generative AI.   This is a beginner level course for a general audience.  No previous knowledge or experience of Generative AI is required.  It focuses on one form of Generative AI: large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.  These can engage in a conversation with users: plan, brainstorm, summarise, explain... and often include skills such as data analysis. They have practical use and can increase our productivity today. 

The course covers:
* an introduction to Generative AI and an explanation of LLMs;
* getting started with generative AI; signing up to a free service
* a tour of some current Generative AI services and LLMs: Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Clause and Google's Gemini;
* practical exercises on how to use LLMs effectively (prompt engineering) to be more productive in everyday tasks;

The course may include several specific use cases of using AI tools if attendees find these relevant to their work:
* to help us with Excel challenges;
* to analyse data;
* to help use write code in SQL;
* to help use write code in Python (the de-facto open source language for data science and AI) and
* to help use write code in DAX (the modelling language of Power BI).

The course finishes with a brief explanation of how Generative AI works "under the covers".
