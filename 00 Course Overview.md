# Generative AI Course Overview

These are the materials for a one day course - an introduction to Generative AI.   This is a beginner level course for a general audience.  No previous knowledge or experience of  Generative AI is required.  It focuses on one mode of Generative AI: large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.  These can engage in a conversation with users: plan, brainstorm, summarise, explain... and often include skills such as data analysis. They have practical use and can increase our productivity today. 

The course covers
* an introduction to Generative AI and an explanation of LLMs,
* a tour of some current Generative AI services and LLMs: Microsoft's Copilot, OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini,
* practical exercises on how to use LLMs effectively (prompt engineering),
* using LLMs for data analysis,
* a brief explanation of how Generative AI works "under the covers".
