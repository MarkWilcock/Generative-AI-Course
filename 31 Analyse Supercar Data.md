# Exercise - Analyse Supercars from the 1970s

MT Cars is a famous statistical dataset.  The data comes from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine and contains fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32  supercars of the time.  The objective of this exercise is to analyse what factors contribute to fuel efficiency (measured in the mpg column).

Download the data from [here](./Resources/mtcars.csv).

Here is the description of the column (variable) names
* model, Model Name
* mpg, Miles/(US) gallon
* cyl, Number of cylinders
* disp, Displacement (cu.in.)
* hp, Gross horsepower
* drat, Rear axle ratio
* wt, Weight (1000 lbs)
* qsec, 1/4 mile time
* vs, Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
* am, Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
* gear, Number of forward gears
* carb, Number of carburettors


FYI: This is data from the US and the 1970s so is expressed on American Imperial units.  The mpg is expressed in miles per US gallon and weight in pounds (lb).  You may want to convert to more familiar units such as miles per litre.  There are 3.785 litres in a US gallon.  A pounds (lb) of weight is 0.454 kg.
