# Use AI tools Effectively

Generative AI tools are useful to us _today_. They can help us do some tasks better and other tasks quicker.  AI tools, such as large language models, have been trained to provide relevant helpful responses to any questions we may pose to them.  For example, they can:
* answer a question with useful relevant information, 
* provide step-by-step instructions for a task,
* draft a letter with the right tone and style,
* review and suggest improvements to a document or text,
* brainstorm ideas on a topic and
* explain and summarise a document.

Most commercial popular AI tools have both free and paid versions.  In this course, the free version is sufficient for most tasks. 

In the exercises, you will use a AI tool to provide helpful answer to relevant tasks.  Before you start, note that AI tools have weaknesses as well as considerable strengths.  Here are the three points to bear in mind:
1. AI tools can make mistakes. Always check any important results independently.
2. AI tools remember and learn from every prompt. Never put any confidential information into AI tools. Keep your data private.
3. AI tools have learnt from everything on the internet: all the amazing, wonderful content but also some undesirable stuff. They have “guard rails” in place but they are capable of generating harmful content or exhibiting bias so review their output carefully!

In the following exercises, we will work in groups of about 4 - 5 people in breakout rooms for about 10 - 15 minutes. Once back in the main room, a spokesperson for each group will summarise their conclusions to the class.  In previous course, students preferred to give themselves 5 minutes or so to work individually before the group discussion commenced - check with your group if you want to do this. 

## Exercise 1 - start a converation about an everyday topic

To get started, sign in to your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, Gemini or other).

Ask the AI tool a few questions and study its responses.  Consider:
* was the response helpful?  
* was the response what you expected?

Here are a few ideas for prompts, but please use your own ideas also.
* Explain a section 42 notice under the leasehold reform Housing & Development act of 1993.
* Create a 5 step plan for the NHS to handle the next pandemic.
* Explain to me like I am a five year old what the NHS does.
* If 3x + 4 = 19, what is x?  Explain your reasoning
* How do I switch off sharing to OneDrive folders?
* Generate 10 geography questions suitable for a pub quiz.
* Tell me briefly about the Alamo.
* How can I turn off shopping and adverts in Microsoft Edge?
* Please [read the text in | describe] the attached image. (_note: you will need to attach an image file - ensure that it includes nothing confidential_)

## Exercise 2 - continue the conversation

Continue the conversation and provide a follow up prompt, with more specific details and/or a clarification or extension of your original question.  Consider:
* does this improve the AI tool's response?
* how much does this feel like a natural conversation?

You can continue to write further follow up prompts based on the AI's latest response in an back and forth manner.

## Exercise 3 - experiment with different styles 

Try various styles of conversation and tasks.  For example, ask the AI tool to brainstorm, plan, explain, summarise and critique, and suggest solutions to problems. Here are some suggestions to get you started but please use your own ideas.

**Brainstorm:**  
* Provide some suggestions for a surpise birthday party.  
* I am writing a spy novel. Suggest some titles that will make it fly off the bookshelves. 

**Plan:**  
* How do I make the perfect omelette?  Provide a step by step instructions.
* I am planning a trip to Paris in the spring.  Could you suggest 10 top tourist sights?

**Summarise and critique/ review:**  
Copy an article from a public web page, for example a news article, then ask:  
* Please summarise in fewer than 300 words
* How could this article be improved to make more clear and compelling?
* The article discusses ... (e.g. rise of vaping in the UK and suggests it is a good thing).  Provide three arguments to support this conclusion and three argument against it.
* Explain the main points of the article as if speaking to a 10 year old child.

Examples 

Please summarise the information in this webpage into two paragraphs https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly_Come_Dancing_series_21

[This PDF](./Resources/WITN01020100.pdf) contains a long legal document - the witness statement of the CEO of the Post Office to the Horizon IT Inquiry.  It is 861 pages long with over 1,880 sections.  Download this file to your PC, then upload to the AI with a prompt like this.  
_Please summarise the information in this PDF into 10 paragraphs.  Give a title to each paragraph._

**Understand what went wrong and suggest how to fix it.** 
* This Excel formula produces incorrect results in some cells but is correct in others.  Can you explain why?  
=XLOOKUP(G18,$D$18:$D$21,$C18:$C$21)  

**Explain:**  
* Explain the organisational structure of the NHS in 3 paragraphs.
* Why is the sky blue?  And the grass green?

## How to get better responses from AI tools

We talk with AI tools by providing a question or instruction (called a prompt). The AI tool responds and then we can prompt again and the AI tool will respond again – and so on.  We can help AI tools help us with more relevant, accurate responses if we provide more tailored prompts. One framework to help us with this is RICE: this stands for Role, Instructions, Context (and Constraints) and Examples. 
* Role: ask the AI tool to act in a certain role e.g., an expert travel advisor, and tell it how to respond e.g. brief or verbose, friendly or formal. Also, for example, tell the AI tool to provide a link to a relevant web page with each response.
* Instructions: provide specific, concrete instructions to the AI tool. (This is the most important piece of advice.)
* Context (and constraints): provide background information that will help the AI tool tailor its response.
* Example: provide an example of the sort of response that you would like to see. 

## Top tips for using AI tools

A basic instruction alone may not result in a good response.  Here are a few pointers to obtain better responses from AI tools.

* Make the instruction more specific.
* Tell GPT what role you want it to play.
* Provide context and relevant background.
* Describe any constraints.
* Provide an example of the response required.
* Refine your prompt and continue the conversation.
* Use RICE to remember: Role, Instructions, Context & Constraints, Examples.
* Create a new chat and ask a new question on a different topic.

### Exercise: Improve the AI tool responses

In this exercise we gradually improve our prompts to improve the responses from the AI tool.  We start with a vague prompt and the AI tool replies in a good but not particularly helpful manner. We then use the RICE framework to improve our prompts and the AI tool responds with more useful suggestions.

In the instructions there are some example prompts, to plan a family summer holiday, but please use your own ideas. 

### Task 1 
Start with a vague but typical prompt.

Suggest 5 ideas for good holiday.

### Task  2
Provide a more detailed, specific prompt using the RICE framework. Build this up step-by-step.

Role: Act as an expert in holiday planning.  Your clients live in the UK.  Keep your responses brief. Provide a link for any suggestions that you make.

Instructions: Suggest 5 ideas for good summer holiday for a family from London.

Constraints / Context:  Here is some more information about us. We live in London but would like to holiday abroad. We like exploring cities but also want to get out of the city to walk in beautiful countryside. We are interested in football stadiums, so we would consider visiting cities that are home to a prominent football team. We don't want to fly to go on holiday.  We are happy to take the train or do a cruise.   Please revise your suggestions.

Here is an example of the type of response I need.  
Milan is a lovely city for families on holiday.  It has many attractions e.g. the Duomo, Michaelangelo's Last Supper.  There are beautiful tourist locations near to the city. for example, Bergamo is a historic hilltop town only a short train journey from Milan.  The famous San Siro football stadium, used by both AC Milan and Inter Milan, is situated on the outskirts of the city.  Milan can be reached by train from London with an overnight stop in Paris.
