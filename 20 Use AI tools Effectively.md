# Use AI tools Effectively

Generative AI tools are useful to us _today_. They can help us do some tasks better and other tasks quicker.  AI tools, such as large language models, have been trained to provide relevant helpful responses to any questions we may pose to them.  For example, they can:
* answer a question with useful relevant information, 
* provide step-by-step instructions for a task,
* draft a letter with the right tone and style,
* review and suggest improvements to a document or text,
* brainstorm ideas on a topic and
* explain and summarise a document.

AI tools have weaknesses as well as considerable strengths.  Here are the three points to bear in mind:
1. AI tools can make mistakes. And when they do lie to us, they do it very convincingly and confidently. Always check any important results independently.
2. AI tools remember and learn from every prompt. Never put any confidential information into AI tools. Keep your data private.
3. AI tools have learnt from everything on the internet: all the amazing, wonderful content but also some undesirable stuff. They have “guard rails” in place but they are capable of generating harmful content or exhibiting bias so review their output carefully!


## Top tips to get better responses from AI tools

A basic instruction alone may not result in a good response.  We talk with AI tools by providing a question or instruction (called a prompt). The AI tool responds and then we can prompt again and the AI tool will respond again – and so on.  We can help AI tools help us with more relevant, accurate responses if we provide more tailored prompts.  Here are a few pointers to obtain better responses from AI tools.
* Make the instruction more specific.
* Tell GPT what role you want it to play.
* Provide context and relevant background.
* Describe any constraints.
* Provide an example of the response required.
* Refine your prompt and continue the conversation.
* Create a new chat and ask a new question on a different topic.

One framework to help us with this is RICE: this stands for Role, Instructions, Context (and Constraints) and Examples. 
* Role: ask the AI tool to act in a certain role e.g., an expert travel advisor, and tell it how to respond e.g. brief or verbose, friendly or formal. Also, for example, tell the AI tool to provide a link to a relevant web page with each response.
* Instructions: provide specific, concrete instructions to the AI tool. (This is the most important piece of advice.)
* Context (and constraints): provide background information that will help the AI tool tailor its response.
* Example: provide an example of the sort of response that you would like to see.

What is the difference between an AI tool and the BBC Radio 4 show 'The Unbelievable Truth'?
1. They are both hosted by David Mitchell.
1. AI tools may hide a few lies in a a largely truthful response whereas the show hides a few truths in a sea of lies.
1. This is a stupid question: we cannot compare an AI tool with a radio show.
## Tutorial - start a conversation with an AI about an everyday topic or task at work.




We will provide a prompt to an AI tool and study its responses.  Consider:
1. If 3x + 4 = 19, what is x?  Explain your reasoning

1. Download [this image](./Resources/NHS_Staff_Nurses_Doctors_Group.webp) to your computer. The image comes from [this page](https://www.nhsemployers.org/news/latest-nhs-workforce-and-vacancy-statistics) on the NHS Employers website.  Upload to the AI tool and then prompt the AI to describe the attached image.

1. Download [this image](./Resources/NHS%20ART.jpg.webp) to your computer. The image comes from [this page](https://ifs.org.uk/articles/state-nhs) on the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) website.  This is a more complex image: more people, police and healthcase workers, engaged in an protest / demonstration activity and a city background. Upload to the AI tool and then prompt the AI to describe the attached image.  See if the AI reads the messages on the banners.  If not, prompt it to do so.

1. This page https://digital-transformation.hee.nhs.uk/building-a-digital-workforce/phillips-ives-review and the pages that it links to, explain The Phillips Ives Nursing and Midwifery Review. Summarise the content of these pages in 5 short paragraphs.





### Summarise and critique/ review
Download a document from a public web page and then prompt the AI to summarise and review the document.  Example prompts are:
* Please summarise in fewer than 300 words
* How could this article be improved to make more clear and compelling?
* The article discusses ... (e.g. rise of vaping in the UK and suggests it is a good thing).  Provide three arguments to support this conclusion and three argument against it.
* Explain the main points of the article as if speaking to a 10 year old child.

_Examples_

[This PDF](./Resources/WITN01020100.pdf) contains a long legal document - the witness statement of the CEO of the Post Office to the Horizon IT Inquiry.  It is 861 pages long with over 1,880 sections.  Download this file to your PC, then upload to the AI with a prompt like this.  
_Please summarise the information in this PDF into 10 paragraphs.  Give a title to each paragraph._

This prompt asks the AI to search several related webpages, a pages specified in the URL and the linked web pages.  
_Read this page https://www.nhs.uk/better-health/ and the pages that it links to, and summarise NHS advice for better health in 5 short paragraphs._
